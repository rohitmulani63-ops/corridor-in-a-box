# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once it reaches
1.0. While pre-1.0, minor versions may contain breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Maintenance — ESLint 10 landed

- `eslint` 10 landed in [#37](https://github.com/ezedike-evan/corridor-in-a-box/pull/37).
  The older deferred-upgrade note below records the state at the time; the
  `vitest` major-version upgrade remains deferred.
- Until a `v0.1.0` tag exists, [Unreleased] links to repository commit history
  rather than a release comparison. The historical 0.1.0 section below remains
  unlinked until its release commit can be tagged.

### Security — soroban-sdk 25 → 27 clears GHSA-x57h-xx53-v53w (2026-08-31)

`contracts/Cargo.lock` pinned `stellar-xdr@25.0.0`, which carries a moderate
advisory ([GHSA-x57h-xx53-v53w](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x57h-xx53-v53w):
`StringM::from_str` accepts strings past the declared max length instead of
rejecting them). It was failing `dependency-review` on every PR.

It could not be patched in place. `soroban-sdk-macros` pins
`stellar-xdr = "=25.0.0"` exactly, and every 25.x release of the SDK locks to
that same vulnerable version, so neither `cargo update -p soroban-sdk` nor
`cargo update -p stellar-xdr --precise 25.0.1` could move it. The fix exists only
from soroban-sdk 26 onwards.

`soroban-sdk` moves to `"27"` (resolving 27.0.6), which brings `stellar-xdr`
27.0.0. **No contract source changed** — the 25 → 27 API surface used by these
contracts is unchanged, and all 21 tests, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy
--all-targets -D warnings` and the `wasm32v1-none` release build pass untouched.

`contracts/deployments.json` is deliberately left alone. The SDK bump changes
the compiled WASM, so the testnet contracts no longer match a `main` build
byte-for-byte, but nothing in the contracts calls the affected code: they handle
only `soroban_sdk::String` host handles, never `stellar-xdr` directly, and never
`StringM::from_str`. Redeploying testnet is worth doing to keep the recorded
addresses matching a `main` build, but it needs the deployer key and is a
maintainer decision rather than part of clearing the advisory.

### Added — `pnpm verify:corridor` (2026-08-31)

`pnpm verify:settle` proves the settle leg on live testnet. There was no
equivalent for a whole corridor run — quote → comply → open → settle → reconcile
→ completed — against the local reference server, so "does the full corridor
work end to end" was a manual, undocumented procedure.

`examples/verify-corridor.ts` drives one payment through every leg against the
Anchor Platform reference server and exits non-zero unless the terminal state is
`completed`. It is a gate rather than a capture: distinct exit codes let CI tell
"the stack was not ready" from "the corridor ran and did not complete", and the
trail is printed on both paths — reconstructed from the audit sink, so the
FAILING run gets one too, which is the case worth reading.

It fails early rather than hanging: `reference-anchor.sh doctor` runs before a
payment is opened, and the bridge asset is checked against the anchor's SEP-38
`/info` (its own statement of what it will quote) so a wrong issuer is named up
front instead of surfacing well after the quote. Every leg is pinned to the local
reference server regardless of what the manifest says, and a `network: public`
manifest is refused outright with no override — this runner drives payments at
localhost, so mainnet here is always a mistake rather than a decision.

### Added — `reference-anchor.sh doctor` (2026-08-31)

When the reference anchor's observer falls behind, the symptom is a corridor run
that reaches `settled`, polls for the whole of `recovery.timeout_seconds` and
then fails with `SETTLEMENT_TIMEOUT` — minutes spent discovering something that
was knowable before the run started.

`doctor` checks the stack up front and exits non-zero, naming the failing check,
so it can gate a CI job or a `verify:corridor` run: every expected container is
running, SEP-1 serves, SEP-31 `/info` advertises a non-empty receive list (the
asset codes are printed, since "which asset can I receive today" is the question
§1 tells you to ask), and the observer's cursor lag against Horizon.

The lag is reported as a number of ledgers rather than a boolean, because the
borderline cases are the ones worth seeing. It fails past
`CURSOR_LAG_FAIL_LEDGERS`, defaulting to 180 — the default
`recovery.timeout_seconds` of 900s at testnet's ~5s close time, past which an
observer cannot catch up to a fresh payment before the engine stops waiting.

### Fixed — reference anchor started its observer on a stale cursor (2026-08-31)

`scripts/reference-anchor.sh up` started the Stellar observer with whatever
cursor was already in the platform DB. When that cursor was behind the ledger
the settle leg landed in, the observer never matched the incoming payment and
the transaction sat at `pending_sender` until the engine gave up with
`SETTLEMENT_TIMEOUT` — the one full-stack attempt so far failed exactly this
way, and it read as an engine bug rather than the harness bug it was.

The cursor is not a config value: Anchor Platform 2.x keeps it in the platform
DB (`stellar_payment_observer_page_token`, one row keyed `SINGLETON_ID`) and
only falls back to Horizon's latest cursor when that row is absent, so a row
left over from an earlier run is precisely how a stale value leaks into a fresh
start. `up` now clears that row and reseeds it from Horizon's current ledger
minus a safety margin, and prints the ledger it chose. Three ordering details
that all turned out to matter:

- The observer is started **after** the platform server rather than alongside
  it, because the table being seeded is created by that server's Flyway
  migration.
- Any running observer is **stopped before** the seed. A live observer writes
  its own paging token back to that row as it streams, so seeding underneath
  one is overwritten within milliseconds and the new cursor never takes effect.
- The observer container is recreated on every `up`, so it cannot resume from
  the position a previous run left behind.

`START_LEDGER`, `CURSOR_MARGIN_LEDGERS` and `HORIZON_URL` override the
behaviour; see the script header and `docs/operations.md` §1.

Two further fixes in the same path, both of which made the above unverifiable
until they were dealt with:

- Config extraction aborted `up` outright when its first `podman exec` raced
  the container's start, because `set -e` plus `pipefail` treats the failed
  command substitution as fatal. The probe is now guarded, which is what the
  surrounding retry loop always intended.
- The readiness-failure path dumped logs from a container named `ap`, which
  this script has never created, so a failed `up` printed nothing useful. It
  reads `ap-sep` now.

### Fixed — refunded runbook implied a reversal that never happens (2026-08-29)

`docs/operations.md`'s `refunded` section said the engine "reversed (or had
nothing to reverse)" the payment. With the real `StellarSettlementSubmitter`
the engine never reverses anything — `refund()` always fails and the run
escalates to `held` — so `refunded` is reachable only when no on-chain payment
ever went out. The old wording could send an operator away satisfied while
money sat with an anchor. The section now states the precondition plainly
(`stellar_tx_hash` must be unset; if set, treat as `held` and file a bug —
and an unset hash is the engine's belief, not proof: on an ambiguous
submission, verify against Horizon before declaring the sender whole), the
"why there is no automated refund" reasoning — on-chain reversal impossible,
and SEP-31 offering the sender no refund endpoint — appears once in full and
is linked from the `held`/`refunded` sections, and the `held` steps say
"contact the anchor" outright instead of gesturing at a refund flow that has
no API. ROADMAP's refund item gets the same precision.

### Added — SEP-31 refund initiation fails closed with `REFUND_UNSUPPORTED` (2026-08-29)

SEP-31 defines no sender-initiated refund endpoint: a refund is a decision the
receiving anchor makes on its own side, only reported back through the
transaction record's `refunds` object. So `Sep31Adapter.requestRefund()` is
now an explicit, documented fail-closed — it returns the new non-retryable
`REFUND_UNSUPPORTED` error code without touching the network, and the message
points at the out-of-band runbook path instead. Anything else would be a
bespoke, anchor-specific endpoint dressed up as protocol conformance; anchors
that do expose a proprietary refund API belong behind their own
`AnchorAdapter` implementation, not in `packages/sep31`. Nothing calls the
method yet (whether refund initiation belongs on the `AnchorAdapter` port is
a separate design decision); it exists to occupy the name with the refusal.
The engine's escalation of a refused refund to `held` is asserted at the
engine seam, the service maps the code to HTTP 501, the on-chain submitter's
refusal message now points at the out-of-band runbook instead of a "SEP-31
anchor refund" flow that does not exist, and `docs/sep-coverage.md` states
the scope boundary plainly.

### Added — `refund_pending` state for anchor-driven refunds (2026-08-29)

The corridor state machine gains `refund_pending`: "we asked the receiving
anchor to refund and are waiting to hear back." Today refunds always fail
immediately and the run lands in `held`, so the state has no producer yet —
but once refunds are anchor-driven they become asynchronous, and an async
operation with no state of its own is a run that looks finished while money
is still in motion. Entered only from `recovering`; exits only to
`refunded`, `held`, or `failed`; not terminal. It inherits `recovering`'s
double-spend contract in full — every successor is terminal, so `settling`
is unreachable from it by construction, and the property suite now asserts
that over all paths (the same all-paths check that historically caught
`settled -> recovering -> settling`). Both idempotency stores round-trip the
new state (it is just a string, but the tests assert it rather than assume
it, including against real Postgres).

### Fixed — probe missed single-quoted stellar.toml values (2026-08-11)

`tomlValue()` only matched double-quoted `KEY = "value"` lines. Both quote
styles are valid TOML, and real anchors use both — `cowrie.exchange`'s live
`stellar.toml` is entirely single-quoted, so a live probe against it detected
only SEP-1 (the toml itself) and silently missed its real SEP-10, SEP-12, and
SEP-31 support. Found by actually running `@corridor/probe` against a real
anchor rather than only against test fixtures, which had only ever used
double quotes. Fixed to accept either quote style; regression tests in
`tests/probe.test.ts` cover both. Re-probing after the fix confirmed
`cowrie.exchange` for real: SEP-10 challenge signed and exchanged for a JWT,
SEP-12 answered, SEP-31 `/info` returned a non-empty receive list (NGNT,
USDC) — added as the `ng-cowrie` corridor in `web/lib/corridors.ts`, the
first corridor in the repo with `endpoints_verified_at` actually set. No
SEP-38 quote server is published, so its `quote_source` is `external`, and no
payment has been attempted — a real settlement still needs a KYC'd business
relationship with Cowrie that this repo does not have.

### Fixed — correctness & security (2026-08-10 audit)

A second audit pass, this time over the settle leg, the on-chain registry
probe, and credential comparisons. Each finding below is covered by a new
regression test (`tests/stellar.test.ts`, `tests/engine.test.ts`,
`tests/probe.test.ts`, `tests/types.test.ts`).

- **An ambiguous Stellar submission was blindly retried — a real
  double-payment path.** `StellarSettlementSubmitter.submit()` caught every
  exception from `submitTransaction()` identically, including a client-side
  network timeout that can happen AFTER Horizon already applied the
  transaction. The retry loop then built and sent an independently-valid
  second payment for the same amount and destination. `submit()` now
  distinguishes a confirmed Horizon rejection (`TransactionFailedError`,
  e.g. `tx_bad_seq` — safe to retry) from a genuinely ambiguous failure,
  which it resolves by looking the transaction up by its precomputed hash
  before deciding, mirroring the pattern `@corridor/attester` already used
  correctly. `confirm()`'s own poll-timeout path was also flipped from
  retryable to non-retryable for the same reason — a confirmation timeout on
  an already-accepted transaction is read-side lag, not proof of failure.
- **No serialization across concurrent settlements from one signer.**
  `loadAccount()` was called fresh, unlocked, on every `submit()` — two
  concurrent payments from the same account could read the same sequence
  number and race. Added a minimal per-instance async lock around
  `loadAccount → build → sign → submitTransaction`, released immediately
  after submission (not held through the slower `confirm()` poll, so one
  ambiguous submission can't head-of-line-block every other in-flight
  payment).
- **A firm quote's expiry was checked once, then never again for the rest of
  the settle/retry loop.** A slow anchor or a couple of retries could settle
  at a stale, no-longer-honoured rate with no error. The retry loop now
  re-checks `expiresAt` on every pass and fails closed (`QUOTE_EXPIRED`)
  rather than submitting against a dead quote.
- **SSRF via unvalidated `stellar.toml` endpoints in `@corridor/probe`.**
  `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT` / `ANCHOR_QUOTE_SERVER` / `KYC_SERVER` /
  `DIRECT_PAYMENT_SERVER` were fetched straight out of a target domain's own
  toml with no host or scheme validation — reachable via the repo's own
  "open a PR to add an anchor domain" flow. Added `isSafeUrl()`
  (`packages/probe/src/url-safety.ts`), a single choke point in the shared
  `get()` helper that refuses non-`https` and loopback/link-local/RFC1918/
  metadata-endpoint hosts. Hostname/IP-literal only — does not close DNS
  rebinding, tracked as a follow-up.
- **Non-constant-time credential comparisons.** The web payments route's
  bearer check and `@corridor/service`'s API-key/owner checks used ordinary
  `!==`/`Set.has()`, which leak timing information about how much of a
  presented credential matched. Added `constantTimeEqual` (`@corridor/types`)
  and used it at every credential-comparison site; `Set.has()` lookups now
  iterate and compare every candidate in constant time rather than
  short-circuiting on the first (or hash-bucket) match.
- **`release.yml`'s tag/version-match guard could be bypassed via manual
  `workflow_dispatch`.** The check only ran `if:` the ref was a `cli-v*` tag
  push; a manual dispatch run skipped it entirely and published whatever
  `package.json` said. The check now runs unconditionally on both trigger
  paths, looking up a matching tag by commit SHA when the ref itself isn't
  one.
- `contracts/{registry,attester}/test_snapshots/` (soroban-sdk `testutils`
  ledger-state dumps) are no longer tracked in git — nothing reads them
  back, they regenerated dirty on every `cargo test` run, and their missing
  trailing newline broke `pnpm lint` for anyone who ran the contract tests
  first.
- Bumped `typescript-eslint` and `tsup` to clear their patched advisories
  (brace-expansion DoS, esbuild dev-server file read). At the time, `vitest`
  and `eslint` carried the remaining dev-only advisories and needed major-
  version bumps (2→5, 9→10) to clear them; those upgrades were deferred as
  separate, deliberate work. `pnpm audit --prod` was clean, and none of those
  dependencies shipped in a built artifact.

### Fixed — correctness & security

Findings from an audit of this repo. Each was confirmed by execution against the
code as shipped, and each is now covered by a regression test in
`tests/security.test.ts`.

- **Negative amounts settled.** `isValidAmount` is a _signed_ syntax check
  (`subAmounts` needs negatives) and was the only guard at both the HTTP boundary
  and the engine entry point, so `POST /payments` with `"-100.00"` returned
  `200 completed` and handed the negative amount to the settlement submitter.
  Added `isSettleableAmount` (well-formed **and** strictly positive) and used it
  at both boundaries, plus an optional per-corridor `limits.max_amount` ceiling.
- **KYC was checked against the wrong account.** The SEP-12 status query was
  keyed to the operator's own SEP-10 signing account whenever a signer was
  configured — which is every production wiring — so `comply` answered "is the
  operator in good standing?" and recorded the result as the _recipient's_
  verdict. It now queries the recipient's SEP-12 customer id
  (`PartyRef.sep12Id`) and fails closed when there isn't one. Relatedly,
  `openTransaction` now sends `receiver_id`/`sender_id`, which it previously
  omitted entirely.
- **SEP-10 authentication failed open.** `authToken()` returned `undefined` on
  every failure path and callers proceeded _anonymously_, so an anchor that
  errored on `/auth` still had its SEP-12 answer accepted as an authenticated
  compliance verdict. Auth failure is now a hard, retryable error whenever a
  signer is configured.
- **`GET /payments/:key` leaked across tenants.** Any valid API key could read
  any run — including its `stellarTxHash` — by guessing a caller-chosen
  idempotency key. Runs now carry an `owner` set from the validated credential,
  reads are scoped to it, and only the error _code_ is returned rather than the
  stored message (which carries anchor URLs and upstream response bodies).
- **Failed authentication was not rate-limited.** The `401` returned before the
  limiter, so API keys could be brute-forced at line rate. Rate limiting now runs
  first.
- **The rate limiter was bypassable.** It keyed off the _unvalidated_ bearer
  token, so rotating the token minted a fresh bucket per request. It now keys off
  a recognised key, falling back to the client IP.
- **The SEP-38 `sell_amount` was discarded.** The anchor's own sell amount was
  parsed and thrown away, so the settle leg paid the amount originally requested
  rather than the one the firm quote bound to. Quotes are also now rejected when
  `buy_amount` contradicts `price × sell_amount` beyond a rounding tolerance.
- **The web API route lent out its credentials.** It proxied any anonymous
  caller's body to the internal `@corridor/service` _with the server's API key_
  attached. Proxying now requires `CORRIDOR_WEB_API_KEY` and fails closed if the
  proxy is configured without one. Added a request body-size cap; the demo's
  in-memory run store is now bounded.
- **Security headers.** The web app now sends CSP, `X-Frame-Options`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy`.
- **Stuck spinner.** A failed `fetch` in the payment runner threw with `running`
  still true, disabling the button until a page reload. Also fixed the failed-step
  highlight, which was computed from a hardcoded state and never rendered.

### Changed — honesty of reported status

- **Liveness now has three states, not two.** `runnable`/`not runnable` was
  derived purely from whether an endpoint string was non-empty, so a manifest
  naming a fictional anchor was reported as healthy by both `corridor plan` and
  the dashboard. Corridors are now `VERIFIED` (endpoints confirmed against a
  published `stellar.toml` on a recorded date, via the new
  `dest.endpoints.endpoints_verified_at`), `UNVERIFIED` (present but unchecked —
  **the honest default**, and where every corridor in this repo currently sits),
  or `NOT RUNNABLE`.
- **`mx-bitso.corridor.yaml` renamed to `mx-example.corridor.yaml`** and stripped
  of the company name. Its endpoints are and always were fictional; naming a real
  company on it implied a relationship that does not exist.
- **Two ROADMAP items reverted from ✅ to ⬜** because they did not survive a code
  read: Corridor #1 (a template with placeholder endpoints, not a live lane) and
  "Real refund path (reverse settlement)" (`refund()` unconditionally fails —
  what ships is escalation to a manual `held`, not a reversal). The grant
  proposal's corresponding claims were corrected the same way.

### Added

- GitHub issue and PR templates.
- Separate CI job that typechecks and builds the `web/` showcase app.
- `author`/`maintainers`/`repository` metadata in `package.json` (so the
  `SECURITY.md` reporting pointer resolves).
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `.env.example`.
- Request body-size limit in `@corridor/service` (memory-DoS guard).
- Explicit SEP-31 lifecycle status mapping (`mapSep31Status`) plus contract-shape
  tests for the adapter.
- Env-gated integration test against a real SEP-31 server (`tests/integration/`).
- `docs/operations.md` (runbook) and `docs/sep-coverage.md` (SEP-31 vs SEP-6/24).
- `IdempotencyStore.create()` — an atomic claim (conditional `INSERT … ON
CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in Postgres) implemented by both stores, plus regression
  tests for the concurrent-claim path.
- `PrometheusMetrics` — a zero-dependency `Metrics` sink that renders Prometheus
  text exposition, plus a `metricsText` option on `@corridor/service` that serves
  it at `GET /metrics` (public + unmetered). Runbook gains a Metrics & alerting
  section with `held`/`failed` alert rules.
- Pluggable rate limiting: a `RateLimiter` interface and `rateLimiter` service
  option so a shared (e.g. Redis) limiter can replace the per-process
  `TokenBucket` for multi-replica deployments.
- `gracefulShutdown(server)` helper to drain in-flight requests on SIGTERM/SIGINT.
- One-command testnet runner (`pnpm testnet` → `examples/run-testnet.ts`) wiring
  the real adapter + submitter + Postgres store to capture a live run; refuses
  mainnet without `CORRIDOR_ALLOW_MAINNET=1`.
- Live-Postgres integration test for `PostgresIdempotencyStore` (concurrent
  `create()`, version-guarded `put()`), gated on `CORRIDOR_TEST_DATABASE_URL`,
  with a Postgres service-container CI job.
- The `web/` API route now proxies to a real `@corridor/service` when
  `CORRIDOR_SERVICE_URL` is set; the in-repo simulation is fenced as demo-only.
- README status badges (CI, license, Node).
- One-command service runner (`pnpm serve` → `examples/run-service.ts`) wiring
  the real adapter/submitter/store behind `createService().server().listen()`
  — previously the service was importable but nothing ever started it. Serves
  every corridor manifest in `corridors/`, skipping `network: public` lanes
  unless `CORRIDOR_ALLOW_MAINNET=1`.
- An on-page "build-time snapshot, not a live liveness feed" label on the web
  dashboard's Corridors section — the underlying data was already disclosed in
  a code comment, now it's visible on the page itself.
- Dedicated unit tests for `@corridor/cli`, `@corridor/router`, and
  `@corridor/adapter-kit` — previously exercised only incidentally through
  other packages' tests; `conformanceSuite` had no coverage that actually ran
  in CI.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/dependabot.yml` (npm + github-actions,
  weekly), and a `feature_request.yml` issue template.
- `"engines": {"node": ">=22"}` in every package.json (root, `web/`, and all
  workspace packages), matching `.nvmrc` and the README's Node badge.
- SHA-pinned the GitHub Actions used in CI (previously floating `@v4` tags),
  plus new `codeql.yml` and `dependency-review.yml` workflows.
- `nightly-live-anchor.yml`: re-runs the opt-in live-anchor integration test
  on a schedule; inert until anchor secrets are configured.
- `docs/grant-proposal.md`: SCF Tier-2 draft with milestones mapped to
  ROADMAP.md; budget figures left as explicit placeholders.
- `@corridor/cli` is now npm-publish-ready: a `tsup` build step bundles it to
  a single `dist/index.js` (inlining `@corridor/manifest`/`@corridor/types`;
  `zod`/`yaml` stay real external dependencies), plus `bin`/`files`/
  `exports`/`description`/`license`/`repository`/`publishConfig`. Verified
  by installing the actual packed tarball into a scratch project and running
  the resulting `corridor` bin. The other 8 packages are unpublished still.
- `release.yml`: tag-triggered (`cli-vX.Y.Z`) npm publish workflow for
  `@corridor/cli` — full test suite, bundle build, a smoke run of the built
  bin, a tag↔package-version check, then `npm publish --provenance`. Needs
  one repo secret (`NPM_TOKEN`).
- The live-anchor suite (and the nightly workflow) now honours
  `ANCHOR_ASSET_ISSUER` / `ANCHOR_DEST_ASSET`, and `.env.example` + README
  document verified known-good values for the public SDF test anchor
  (`testanchor.stellar.org`) — the read-only probe runs against a real anchor
  with no self-hosted infrastructure.

- README links the live web dashboard (corridor-in-a-box.vercel.app), which
  the Vercel GitHub integration deploys from `main`.
- **On-chain anchor conformance registry.** New Soroban contracts
  (`contracts/registry`, `contracts/attester`) let an enrolled attester write
  probe-based SEP conformance data on-chain per anchor domain: the registry
  only accepts writes forwarded by the configured attester contract
  (`require_auth` chained through both), enforces a per-domain attestation
  cooldown, and caps storage (`MAX_DOMAINS`). Deployed to testnet — contract
  IDs committed in `contracts/deployments.json`; mainnet fields stay `null`
  by policy until a testnet deployment has been exercised for a wave. 21
  Rust tests, clippy clean.
- `@corridor/probe` — runs real SEP-10/SEP-38/SEP-31 conformance probes
  against a domain's published `stellar.toml` (auth challenge, firm-quote
  expiry check, non-empty SEP-31 receive list) and reports which SEPs are
  advertised vs. actually served.
- `@corridor/attester` — signs and submits a `ProbeResult` through the
  on-chain attester contract; maps raw Soroban host errors to
  operator-readable messages ("not an enrolled attester", "too soon: within
  the cooldown window").
- `attest-anchors.yml` (scheduled + manual dispatch) probes every domain in
  the new `contracts/anchors.json` and submits attestations on-chain when
  `ATTESTER_SECRET` is configured; `nightly-live-anchor.yml` now defaults
  `ANCHOR_*` env vars to public SDF testanchor values when the matching
  secrets are unset, so its live-anchor assertions actually run in CI
  instead of skipping.
- The web dashboard's "Attested anchors" panel now reads the on-chain
  registry (`web/lib/registry.ts`, via a Soroban simulation call — no
  signing key, no fee) instead of showing only the static corridor list.
  The page is incrementally re-rendered on an hourly `revalidate`, so what
  you see is real chain data up to an hour old — **not** a read per request,
  as this entry previously claimed. Each card still reports its own
  attestation age in ledgers, which is the number that actually matters.
  The Corridors section, which is still the static manifest, is explicitly
  labeled "manifest snapshot — not a live liveness probe" so the two are
  never confused.
- `@corridor/router` gained a registry-gated `RouteResolver`
  (`RegistryRouteResolver`): fails closed on an unreachable registry,
  refuses unattested domains, and enforces a max-staleness bound. Opt-in
  alongside the existing static resolver — not yet the default for
  `@corridor/engine` callers.
- `tests/money-properties.test.ts` and `tests/state-properties.test.ts` —
  property-based tests (round-trip/commutativity/associativity for money
  math over ~400 generated cases each; an exhaustive walk of the engine's
  state-transition graph). The state-graph walk found
  `settled -> recovering -> settling` was reachable in the transition table
  (never taken by actual control flow, but reachable by the table alone) —
  see the `retrying`/`recovering` split below.
- Upgraded `@stellar/stellar-sdk` 13 → 16 across every workspace package.

### Fixed

- **The SEP-38 quote request was spec-invalid and every live anchor rejected
  it.** The adapter sent `sell_asset: stellar:USDC` (no issuer — the anchor
  answers 404 `sell_asset not found`) and omitted the required `context`
  field (400 `Unsupported context`). Found by running the opt-in live suite
  against the SDF test anchor; mocks never caught it. `requestQuote` now
  sends `context: "sep31"` and the SEP-38 Asset Identification Format
  (`stellar:CODE:ISSUER`, or `stellar:native` when the bridge asset is XLM),
  with regression tests pinning the exact body. First live-verified firm
  quote followed immediately.

- `.env.example` documented `CORRIDOR_HORIZON_URL`, which nothing in the
  codebase reads — the real scripts read `HORIZON_URL`. Renamed, and added
  the previously-undocumented `MANIFEST`, `CORRIDOR_ALLOW_MAINNET`, and
  `CORRIDORS_DIR` variables.
- **Concurrent double-settlement window in the idempotency gate.** `execute()`
  previously gated on `get()` alone, so two callers racing the same
  `idempotencyKey` could both pass the check and both settle on-chain (the
  `put()` version guard only prevents the stored row from going backwards, not
  two in-flight runs). `execute()` now atomically claims the key via
  `store.create()` before any work and returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` to the
  loser. Addresses the double-settlement scope item in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Unbounded memory in the rate limiter.** The `TokenBucket` map never evicted
  client entries (and the key can be a spoofable `X-Forwarded-For`), an
  exhaustion vector. It now evicts fully-refilled idle buckets (behaviour-neutral)
  and keys off a transport-resolved client IP rather than a raw header — see
  `trustProxy`.
- A thrown error inside the HTTP request handler (e.g. an unreachable idempotency
  DB) now returns `500` instead of hanging the socket / risking a process crash.
- **First real testnet settlement.** `pnpm verify:settle`
  (`examples/verify-settle-leg.ts`) executed a real payment on Stellar
  testnet — transaction hash and ledger committed in ROADMAP.md — closing
  the "settle leg never actually run" gap.
- **Five spec bugs found by running against a real SEP-31 anchor.** Standing
  up the Anchor Platform reference server locally and running the full
  quote → comply → settle flow against it (rather than mocks) surfaced and
  fixed: a SEP-38 `price`/`total_price` inversion, memo type sent as text
  instead of hash, a missing `destination_asset`/`fields.transaction`, a
  SEP-12 `type` mismatch, and Horizon error responses swallowing
  `result_codes`. The resulting corridor run — SEP-10 auth, SEP-12
  registration for both parties, SEP-38 firm quote, SEP-31 transaction
  open, and a settle tx the anchor attributed by hash memo — landed with
  its transaction hash and ledger committed in ROADMAP.md. Separately, the
  new probe/attest packages above independently confirmed
  `testanchor.stellar.org`'s own SEP-31 receive list is empty, so it does
  not actually serve SEP-31 despite advertising it.
- **A settle failure that already moved money could be retried into a
  second payment.** The `recovering` state used to allow re-entering
  `settling`, so a settle failure discovered after reconcile (money already
  on-chain) could, per the state table alone, loop back into resubmitting.
  Found by the new exhaustive state-graph property test, not by any code
  path actually taking it. `recovering` is now split from `retrying`:
  `retrying` is the only state permitted to re-enter `settling`, reserved
  for failures known to have happened before money moved; `recovering` is
  terminal and cannot.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-18

Initial public release: the walking skeleton.

### Added

- `@corridor/types` — `Outcome<T>` no-throw result type and decimal-safe `Money`.
- `@corridor/manifest` — Zod schema + loader for a `*.corridor.yaml`; the corridor
  abstraction.
- `@corridor/adapter-kit` — `AnchorAdapter` port, conformance probes, mock adapter.
- `@corridor/sep31` — one adapter for any standards-compliant SEP-31 anchor
  (SEP-10 auth + SEP-12 KYC; crypto behind an injected signer).
- `@corridor/stellar` — settlement submitter + SEP-10 signer; `ExternalSigner`
  (KMS/HSM) port.
- `@corridor/router` — `RouteResolver` seam + static default.
- `@corridor/engine` — corridor-agnostic orchestration of quote → comply → settle
  → reconcile → recover, with a persisted state machine, crash-resume, recovery,
  audit trail, metrics hooks, and a durable Postgres idempotency store.
- `@corridor/service` — thin HTTP API over the engine (API-key auth, rate limit).
- `@corridor/cli` — manifest validation and an offline runnability `plan`.
- Reference, MX/Bitso, and NG→CN corridor manifests.
- Docs: key management, "why not Anchor Platform".
