// RegistryRouteResolver — refuse to route through an anchor nobody has checked.
//
// This is where the RouteResolver seam becomes code.
//
//   OPEN (here)         Does this anchor demonstrably work, and how recently was
//                       that established? Facts, read from the on-chain registry.
//   NOT INCLUDED        Which of several working anchors should this payment go
//                       through? Health scoring, rate weighting, split routing.
//                       Not part of this repo; a resolver like that could be
//                       supplied separately through the same interface.
//
// This resolver is a GATE, not a chooser: it answers yes/no on evidence and
// nothing more. That is deliberate — a gate is exactly the piece that has to be
// auditable, because it is what stands between an operator and settling into a
// lane that does not exist.
//
// It is also the engine-side counterpart to the dashboard fix. The dashboard
// stopped *displaying* unverified anchors as healthy; this stops the engine
// *settling* through them.
